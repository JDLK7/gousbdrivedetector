# Detecting USB Storage Drives in Go

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/deepakjois/gousbdrivedetector?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/deepakjois/gousbdrivedetector)

Simple API to detect USB Storage device for Go. Works for OS X and Linux.

Support for Windows should be easy to implement. It is pending because I donâ€™t
have a machine to test. Contributions are welcome.

### Usage
Check the [example] folder.
